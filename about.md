I currently work as a Data Scientist for the San Francisco Casualty practice of Milliman, an insurance consulting firm with offices around the globe. In my free time I enjoy all kinds of activities such as skiing, road biking, cooking, coffee brewing, trumpet playing, and hiking. You can reach me via email at [mailto](nicholashanoian@gmail.com). Check me out on [Github](https://github.com/nicholashanoian).
